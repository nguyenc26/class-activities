    // How would we log...

    // The car's make?

    console.log(car.make);

    // The car's model?

    console.log(car.model);

    // The car's mileage?

    console.log(car.mileage)

    // How would we run the car's driveToWork method?

    car.driveToWork();

    // How would we run the car's driveAroundWorld method?

    car.driveAroundWorld();

    // How would we run the getTuneUp method?

    car.getTuneUp();


//the only reason why this works because you are calling the pointing at the car and then pointing at the function because the function is within the car variable. If you tried to reference the drivearoundworld without the car, it wouldn't work. It wont recognize the function outside of the variable.
